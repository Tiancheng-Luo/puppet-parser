This is a script I wrote to help me clean up a lot of old puppet manifests
that were written using a variety of styles by a variety of authors.

It is written in perl and has only one dependency, Parse::Lex. I have tested
with version 2.15 of Parse::Lex, but it should work fine with any newer
version.

The parser is implemented using a combination of a tokenizer and a custom
grammer-based (or close enough) parsing engine.
